# Stern-Brocot Trees
These magical things are underappreciated in math and number theory, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree

Couldnt find any code that generated them so I did it myself.

I also try a number of different/ unique approaches to evaluating stern brocot trees. I think they really help you understand a potential "meaning" of e, Eulers number, among other things 


There are a few ways to visualize things; combined for instance:

or discrete which is what my code does

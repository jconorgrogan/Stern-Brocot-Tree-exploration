# Stern-Brocot Trees
These magical things are underappreciated in math and number theory, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Brocot_tree

Couldnt find any code that generated them so I did it myself. The tree is zoomable; double click to zoom out.

I also try a number of different/ unique approaches to evaluating stern brocot trees.

As an example, some interesting things I've noticed about the Stern-Brocot tree is related to Khinchin's constant- see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinchin%27s_constant#:~:text=In%20number%20theory%2C%20Aleksandr%20Yakovlevich,is%20known%20as%20Khinchin's%20constant. . Among the numbers x whose continued fraction expansions are known NOT to have this property are rational numbers, roots of quadratic equations (including the golden ratio Φ and the square roots of integers), and the base of the natural logarithm e.---- in other words, all numbers that are defined by repeatable or expiring patterns in stern brocot tree transversals. Said diffrently, numbers that adhere to Khinchin's constant would "zig zag" through this tree in a path that doesn't reveal predictable or repeating patterns, unlike the periodic and terminating paths of quadratic irrationals and rational numbers. 

2. As an example of repeatable continued fractions, This is what im calling the "operation space" of e^2; Its a visualization of essentially how the continued fraction of e^2 in "Stern brocot tree directions".  This number does NOT fit in with Khinchin's constant (I didn't even look it up if this is true, but am able to have confidence in this visually). In other words, knowledge of one slice could perfectly predict knowledge of future slices.

3. - **Stern-Brocot Tree Coverage**: After an infinite number of steps, the entire interval from 0 to 1 will be densely covered by the points (fractions) generated by all the branches of the Stern-Brocot tree.

- **Number of Slices at Step \( n \)**: At the \( n \)th step in both the geometric series for 1 and a branch of the Stern-Brocot tree, there will be \( 2^n \) slices or intervals.

- **Geometric Series and Stern-Brocot Parallel**: Both the geometric series for 1 and a single branch of the Stern-Brocot tree generate a doubling of slices or intervals at each step, leading to \( 2^n \) slices by the \( n \)th step.

- The number of slices at step n is 2× the total number of slices from all prior steps.

-Therefore, at the infinite step, we can say that the points covered cover exactly 1/2 of the area of the interval from 0 to 1.
